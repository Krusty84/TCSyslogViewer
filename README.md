  - **Basic Content**: Overview and primary category hierarchy for the active log.
  - **Extra Content**: Additional parsed groups (SQL, Journals, Security check). Special modes for Teamcenter sever is need!
  - **Favorites**: Parts of the system log that interest you (stored in the file: original file name syslog`.favorite`)
- **Occurrences panel** ‚Äì Capture "Find All Occurrences" runs without re-executing the search every time.

## üîÆ AI Agent configuration

The repository ships with an `mcp_reference/` folder that demonstrates a standalone AI agent backed by DeepSeek/OpenAI/Ollama. The same ideas now live inside the extension:

- All entries from `mcp_reference/config.json` surface as VS Code settings under **TC Syslog Viewer ‚Üí AI** (`provider`, `model`, `apiKey`, `server.authToken`, `workspace`).
- The **AI Chat** view (panel) takes its title from the provider/model so you immediately know which LLM is active.
- When you run `TC Syslog Viewer: Chat w/ AI`, the agent shares the current syslog excerpt/selection with the LLM. The model can call domain tools (log level stats, window snippets, token lookups) via MCP-style function calls before replying in the panel.

If the provider is offline or no API key is configured, the extension falls back to a deterministic local summary so you still receive quick guidance.
